## Example Use Cases

Here are some realistic scenarios where this MCP server can help AI assistants manage PHP projects:

### üöÄ Scenario 1: First-Time Project Analysis

**AI Prompt:**
> "I just inherited this legacy PHP project. Can you analyze it and tell me what state it's in? Check for outdated dependencies, security issues, and validation problems."

**What the AI will do:**
1. Use `analyze_project` to get a comprehensive health report
2. Identify outdated packages and security vulnerabilities
3. Check if composer.json and composer.lock are valid
4. Provide a prioritized list of issues to address

**Expected Output:**
```
Project Analysis for 'acme/legacy-app':

‚úÖ Validation: Passed
üì¶ Dependencies: 47 total (42 require, 5 require-dev)
‚ö†Ô∏è  Outdated: 12 packages need updates
üîí Security: 2 vulnerabilities found (CRITICAL)

Top Priority Issues:
1. [CRITICAL] Security vulnerability in symfony/http-foundation 3.4.2
2. [WARNING] 12 packages are outdated
3. [INFO] Consider updating to PHP 8.4 for better performance

Recommendation: Address security issues immediately, then plan package updates.
```

### üì¶ Scenario 2: TYPO3 Major Version Upgrade

**AI Prompt:**
> "I have this TYPO3 11 project and want to upgrade to TYPO3 12. Check the composer.json: what packages need updating and are there any compatibility issues to be aware of?"

**What the AI will do:**
1. Use `analyze_project` to understand current dependencies
2. Use `suggest_upgrades` with `includeMajor: true` to see TYPO3 12 availability
3. Use `get_package_info` to check TYPO3 12 requirements
4. Search for TYPO3 12 compatible versions of extensions

**Expected Output:**
```
TYPO3 Upgrade Analysis:

Current: TYPO3 11.5.35
Target: TYPO3 12.4.11 (latest)

Core Packages (6 packages):
- typo3/cms-core: 11.5.35 ‚Üí 12.4.11 [MAJOR]
- typo3/cms-backend: 11.5.35 ‚Üí 12.4.11 [MAJOR]
- ... (all core packages follow)

Extensions to Update (8 packages):
- georgringer/news: 9.3.1 ‚Üí 11.0.0 [MAJOR - Breaking changes]
- b13/container: 2.3.0 ‚Üí 2.3.2 [PATCH - Safe]
- mask/mask: 7.1.0 ‚Üí 8.3.1 [MAJOR - Check changelog]

Blocked Extensions (2 packages):
- old/extension: No TYPO3 12 version available yet

Recommendation: Review breaking changes in georgringer/news and mask/mask.
Consider removing or replacing 'old/extension' before upgrading.
```

### üîß Scenario 3: Laravel Project Maintenance

**AI Prompt:**
> "My Laravel 10 application is running in production. Show me only safe (patch and minor) updates I can apply without risk."

**What the AI will do:**
1. Use `suggest_upgrades` with `includeMajor: false` (default)
2. Categorize updates by type
3. Check security advisories
4. Provide a safe update plan

**Expected Output:**
```
Safe Upgrades Available:

Patch Updates (8 packages - Recommended):
- laravel/framework: 10.43.0 ‚Üí 10.48.4 (bug fixes)
- symfony/console: 6.4.3 ‚Üí 6.4.4 (bug fixes)
- guzzlehttp/guzzle: 7.8.1 ‚Üí 7.8.2 (security fix)
- ... (5 more)

Minor Updates (3 packages - Low Risk):
- spatie/laravel-permission: 6.3.0 ‚Üí 6.7.0 (new features)
- league/flysystem: 3.23.0 ‚Üí 3.25.1 (enhancements)
- nesbot/carbon: 2.72.0 ‚Üí 2.72.5 (improvements)

Excluded from this list:
- 2 major version updates (use includeMajor: true to see them)

Recommendation: Apply patch updates immediately. Test minor updates in staging.
Run: composer update --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
```

### üîç Scenario 4: Finding Alternative Packages

**AI Prompt:**
> "I'm using 'doctrine/orm' in my project but it feels too heavy. Search for lightweight PHP ORM alternatives and show me the most popular options."

**What the AI will do:**
1. Use `search_packages` with query "lightweight orm"
2. Use `get_package_info` for top results
3. Compare downloads, GitHub stars, and maintenance status
4. Provide recommendations

**Expected Output:**
```
Lightweight ORM Alternatives:

1. cycle/orm (Most Popular)
   - Downloads: 500K+
   - Favorers: 1.2K
   - Description: PHP DataMapper ORM and Data Modelling Engine
   - Pro: Fast, no annotations, better performance
   - Con: Different paradigm from Doctrine

2. illuminate/database (Laravel's Query Builder)
   - Downloads: 100M+
   - Favorers: 2.5K  
   - Description: Eloquent ORM (can use standalone)
   - Pro: Simple, excellent docs, Active Record pattern
   - Con: Tied to Laravel ecosystem

3. propel/propel
   - Downloads: 5M+
   - Favorers: 1.1K
   - Description: Propel2 is an ORM for PHP
   - Pro: Battle-tested, good performance
   - Con: Less active development

Recommendation: For a greenfield project, try cycle/orm.
For Laravel-style syntax, use illuminate/database.
```

### üõ°Ô∏è Scenario 5: Security Audit Before Deployment

**AI Prompt:**
> "I'm about to deploy my application to production. Run a security check and make sure there are no vulnerable dependencies."

**What the AI will do:**
1. Use `analyze_project` to run security audit
2. Check composer.json validation
3. Verify composer.lock is up to date
4. List all security advisories

**Expected Output:**
```
Pre-Deployment Security Audit:

üîí Security Status: VULNERABILITIES FOUND

‚ùå CRITICAL Issues (1):
1. symfony/http-kernel (5.4.20)
   - CVE-2023-XXXX: HTTP Host Header Injection
